📜 Privacy Policy — Photo Mind AI

Effective Date: 26-10-25

1. Overview

Photo Mind AI (“the App”) values your privacy. This app does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information. All photo enhancement and editing processes occur entirely on your device.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect, store, or share any of the following information:

Personal identifiers (name, email address, phone number, etc.)

Photos or videos from your device (unless you manually select them for editing)

Usage analytics or crash logs

Location data

Biometric or facial recognition data

3. On-Device Processing

All image adjustments and filters (including automatic enhancement) are performed locally on your device.
No image data or metadata leaves your phone. No information is shared with any third party or stored on remote servers.

4. Face Data Clarification

Photo Mind AI does not perform face recognition or identity analysis.
If the system detects a face area, it is used only for basic visual enhancement such as adjusting brightness or contrast — all within the device.
The app does not extract, store, transmit, or share any face data.

5. Data Retention

Since no personal or biometric data is collected, no data is retained.
All temporary processing data is automatically deleted after use.

6. Third-Party Access

The App does not use any third-party SDKs, analytics tools, or advertising frameworks.
No user data is ever shared externally.

7. Your Rights

As the App does not collect or store personal data, no data management actions are required.
All your photos remain under your full control.
