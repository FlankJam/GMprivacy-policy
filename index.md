1. Overview

Photo Mind AI is an image-editing app that offers AI-assisted enhancements and filters.
All processing occurs entirely on your device. The app does not upload, share, or store any personal data or images on external servers.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

Photo Mind AI does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
Specifically, the app does not collect:

Names, email addresses, or contact information

Biometric or facial-recognition data

Photos or videos from your device (unless you manually select them for editing)

When you choose an image to edit, it is processed locally on your device only and never leaves your device.

3. On-Device Processing

All photo analysis, enhancement, and filter application are performed using Apple’s built-in Core Image framework.
No data is sent to any remote server or third-party service.
Temporary data generated during editing is stored in the app’s memory or cache and is automatically cleared once editing is completed or the app is closed.

4. Face Data Clarification

Photo Mind AI does not perform face recognition or identification.
If the app detects a general face area (for example, to improve lighting or apply a beauty filter), this detection is used solely for real-time visual enhancement and occurs entirely on the device.
No facial features are analyzed, extracted, stored, or shared.

5. Data Retention

Since Photo Mind AI does not collect any personal or biometric data, there is no long-term data retention.
Any temporary data used for editing exists only for the duration of the editing session and is automatically deleted when the app closes or the user exits the session.

6. Third-Party Access

The app does not use third-party SDKs, analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks.
Your photo data never leaves your device and is not shared with any external parties.

7. User Rights

Because Photo Mind AI does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data to modify, export, or delete.
If you have any privacy concerns, you may contact the developer directly for clarification.

8. Policy Updates

This privacy policy applies to all users worldwide.
If we make significant updates, the new policy will be posted at the same URL with an updated effective date.
