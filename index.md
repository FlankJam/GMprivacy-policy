MellowMind: Reflection Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 16, 2025

Welcome to MellowMind: Reflection (hereinafter referred to as "the Application"). We understand the importance of your personal information and privacy. This Privacy Policy aims to clearly and transparently explain how we handle your data as a writing and reflection tool that runs entirely locally on your device.

Core Commitment: Your data belongs to you and only to you.

This Application is designed as a purely local application without login or a backend server. All diary entries, reflections, and related data (including but not limited to text, date tags, and mood tags) that you create are stored solely on your personal device (iPhone/iPad). We (the developers) cannot access, collect, upload, or view any of your personal content. This Application is a tool focused on personal writing and reflection, not a medical device, and does not provide psychotherapy, diagnosis, or any form of medical advice.

Please carefully read and understand the entire contents of this Privacy Policy before using this Application.

I. How Do We Collect and Use Information?

Because this app runs locally on your device, our data practices are extremely limited:

**Content You Create:** All journal entries, reflections, and responses you make within the app (collectively, "Content") are stored only on your device's local storage (such as iCloud Drive or on your device). The storage, encryption, and synchronization of this data are managed by Apple's iOS/iPadOS system and iCloud services, and are subject to their privacy policies and terms of service. We do not own, transfer, or have access to this content.

**Anonymous Analytics Information (Optional):** To continuously improve the app experience, we may integrate anonymous analytics frameworks such as Apple's App Analytics. This information is completely anonymous, contains no personally identifiable information or journal content, and is used solely for compiling aggregated data such as "Active Users," "Feature Usage Frequency," and "App Crash Reports." You can completely disable sharing analytics data with developers in your device's Privacy Settings.

**Subscription Status Information:** This app offers premium feature subscriptions, and all purchases are completed and managed through the Apple App Store. We only receive an anonymous, encrypted receipt from Apple to verify your subscription status on your device to unlock the corresponding features. We do not process or store any payment information (such as credit card numbers). II. Data Storage and Security

Storage Location: All your content data is stored locally on your device by default. If you have enabled iCloud sync, data will be encrypted and synced between devices under your personal Apple ID via Apple's iCloud service. This process is controlled by Apple's system.

Data Security: The security of your local device data relies on the security measures of your device's operating system (such as device password, Face ID/Touch ID). The security of iCloud data is guaranteed by Apple. We recommend that you set a strong password for your device and keep your Apple ID credentials safe.

III. Subscription and Value

MellowMind: Reflection is available for free download and use. The premium subscription plan is designed to support the continuous development of the app and unlock richer experiential features for you, such as:

More personalized reflection prompts and writing guidance templates.

Deeper data visualization methods to help you review your writing journey.

Unlimited journal creation and archiving capabilities.

Subscription Management: All subscription purchases, renewals, cancellations, and refunds must be managed through your device's Apple App Store account settings. This app does not directly handle payments or subscription management. To restore purchases or manage subscriptions, please go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions on your device, or directly through the App Store's subscription management page.

IV. Third-Party Services

This app only involves the following system-level services provided by Apple Inc., and its data practices are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy:

iCloud: Used to sync data between your personal devices (optional).

App Store: Used to process in-app purchases and subscriptions.

App Analytics: Used to collect anonymous aggregated data (optional, can be turned off).

V. Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

Access and Deletion: You can view, edit, or permanently delete any entries you create within the app at any time. To completely erase all data, you can uninstall the app (and choose to delete related data), or turn off app syncing in iCloud.

Choose to Exit Analytics: You can stop sharing anonymous data by turning off "Share iPhone Analytics" in Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements on your device.

VI. Children's Privacy

This app is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not intentionally collect information from children. Because all data is stored locally, the responsibility for and oversight of a child's data is the responsibility of their parent or guardian if the child uses this app.

VII. Privacy Policy Changes

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect minor changes in app functionality. The updated policy will be published within the app or through other appropriate means, and the "Last Updated Date" at the top will be updated. Your continued use of this app indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
