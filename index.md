MellowMind: Reflection Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 16, 2025

Welcome to MellowMind: Reflection (“the Application”).
We understand the importance of your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use MellowMind: Reflection.

Core Commitment: Your data belongs to you — and only to you.

MellowMind: Reflection is designed as a local-first journaling and reflection application. It does not require account registration and does not operate its own backend servers. All personal content you create remains under your control.

This Application is intended for personal writing and self-reflection only. It is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Application.

I. Information We Collect and How We Use It

Because MellowMind: Reflection operates locally on your device, our data collection is extremely limited.

1. Content You Create

All journal entries, reflections, prompts, mood tags, timestamps, and related content (“Content”) are stored locally on your device.

We do not collect, upload, store, or access your Content.

If you enable iCloud sync, your Content is encrypted and synchronized between your devices under your personal Apple ID.

Data storage, encryption, and synchronization are handled entirely by Apple’s iOS/iPadOS and iCloud systems and are subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy.

We do not own, analyze, or view your personal writing data.

2. Anonymous Analytics (Optional)

To improve app stability and user experience, we may use Apple App Analytics.

This data is aggregated and anonymous

It does not include journal content or personally identifiable information

Examples include: app launches, feature usage frequency, and crash reports

You may disable analytics sharing at any time via:
Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements

3. Subscription Status Information

MellowMind: Reflection offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions.

All payments are processed securely by Apple’s App Store

We do not collect or store payment information such as credit card details

We only receive an anonymous, encrypted receipt from Apple to verify subscription status on your device and unlock premium features

II. Data Storage and Security
Storage

Content is stored locally on your device by default

If iCloud is enabled, data is encrypted and synced through Apple’s iCloud service

Security

Local data security depends on your device’s security settings (device passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)

iCloud security is managed by Apple

We recommend keeping your device and Apple ID credentials secure.

III. Subscription Information and Value

MellowMind: Reflection is free to download and use.
An optional monthly auto-renewable subscription (USD $4.99 / month) is available to unlock premium features, including but not limited to:

Enhanced and personalized reflection prompts

Subscription Management

Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled

You can manage or cancel your subscription via:

Refunds and billing are handled by Apple according to App Store policies

IV. Third-Party Services

This app only uses the following Apple-provided services:

iCloud (optional): data synchronization

App Store: subscription and payment processing

Apple App Analytics (optional): anonymous usage statistics

All third-party services are governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.

V. Your Rights and Control

You have full control over your data:

Access & Deletion: You may edit or delete any journal entry at any time within the app

Complete Data Removal: Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data from your device. If iCloud sync is enabled, you may manage or delete synced data via iCloud settings

Analytics Control: You may opt out of analytics sharing through system settings

VI. Children’s Privacy

MellowMind: Reflection is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because all data is stored locally, parents or guardians are responsible for supervising a child’s use of the app.
